						My main background on backend side, but at the moment, focal point - frontend development, as it is super fast growing area
						which becoming more and more popular every day.So to be successfull software developer, I should keep my
						knowledge up to date.
					</p>
                    <p>
                         For the start I guess it would be awesome to get all fundamental basics like a HTML, CSS, Javascript
						(pure). And after strong understanting of this area, I should carry on with learning new frameworks and approaches
						of modern web-development.
                    </p>
					<p>
						From another side, I would be glad to try backend development, but from javascript prospective, like a NodeJs or smth similar.
						Today js is a part of every new project, nevermind which technology stack you're using.
